# D3_Project

This project was to analyze census data broken down at the state level and create an interactive graph using d3. 

The graph has three variables per axis that can be viewed by clicking on them. 

The data points display their exact values when hovered over and each state has its abbreviation set as text over the data point. 

Several conclusions can be drawn from examining the data, such as the link in poverty percantage the correlation to obesity.
